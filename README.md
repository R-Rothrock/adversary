# Adversary

Lightweight self-learning rock-paper-scissors engine in C++ that is designed to learn the
moves of it's adversary over time with a simple self-made AI. In the `app` directory
there is code for a _Python **Flask**_ application, which can be run with the scripts in
the `test` directory.

## Development

Bot is somewhat done, but I will continue to imporve on it. In the meantime, I'm
almost done with the front-end (it won't be pretty) but I'm currently working on the
backend.
